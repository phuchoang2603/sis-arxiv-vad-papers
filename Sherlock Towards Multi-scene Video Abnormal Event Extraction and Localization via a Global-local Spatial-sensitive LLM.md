## Abstract

Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., globallocal spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language

## 1 Introduction

Video Understanding is a foundational task in artificial intelligence, which focuses on analyzing and interpreting the content of videos to enable various applications, including video classification, activity recognition, and scene understanding [40 , 58 , 59]. As a critical branch of video understanding, Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) [20], which aims to automatically detect abnormal videos, has garnered significant research attention due to its wide range of applications in criminal activity detection and disaster response [56]. Prior studies on VAD mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video [20 , 29 , 41 , 56]. However, these studies overlook targeting at determining the underlying video semantic structure, i.e., "what is the abnormal type, where they have occurred, which people or things are involved" with a given video.

Motivated by these, this paper proposes a novel Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming at localizing abnormal events (i.e., starting and ending times of the anomaly) and extracting event quadruples (i.e. [subject of the event, event type, object of the event, scene of the event]) through a chat paradigm. Take an example of Street scene in Figure 1 (a), within 23s to 25s, a man bends down and pries the lock, then drives away from the street and the abnormal event quadruple is [people, steal, car, street]. Different scene (i.e., Residence scene) is also shown in Figure 1 (b). Within 15s to 17s, a man vandalizes a sculpture at one's residence and the quadruple is [people, Vandalism, Sculpture, Residence]. This structured processing for abnormal videos can significantly improve the practicality and efficiency of video anomaly localization systems. In fields such as real-time abnormal event monitoring that require high reliability and precision monitoring, using such structured processing can quickly search and screen for the required abnormal elements, which provides more convenient and intuitive evidence for further processing. Therefore, it is worthwhile to address this new task. Nevertheless, we believe that this new task faces two key challenges.

For one thing, it is challenging to model the global-local spatial information (named global-local spatial modeling challenge). Existing video understanding models [34 , 38 , 54] mainly focus on modeling general global information. However, local spatial information in our M-VAE task is often crucial compared to general global information, which are highly discriminative and essential for precise identification. Taking Figure 1 (a) as an example, the local spatial information, such as action (bend down), object relations (&lt;man, near, car&gt;), and background (street), can help better identify abnormal events. However, those local spatial information (e.g., actions, object relations, backgrounds) have different heterogeneous representations (i.e., different model structures and encoders). Therefore, a single, fixed-capacity transformer-based model, often makes it difficult to capture those critical local spatial information in videos. Recently, the Mixture of Expert (MoE) [18 , 23] paradigm has demonstrated scalability in multi-modal heterogeneous representation fusion tasks [18 , 23 , 24]. Inspired by this, a well-behaved model for our task should adopt the MoE paradigm to not only consider global spatial information but also emphasize the importance of local spatial information.

For another, a straightforward approach is to employ a basic Mixture of Expert (MoE) mechanism [18 , 23 , 24] to treat global spatial information (i.e., general representations of videos) and local spatial information (e.g., actions) as the global expert and local experts for integrating those information. However, the data imbalance issue among local spatial information may lead to the basic MoE experts being biased towards the more frequently occurring spatial information in the dataset. The statistics in Figure 1 (c) can illustrate this imbalance. Certain frequently appearing local information (i.e., action at 45%), can lead to higher weight for the corresponding expert. However, in Figure 1 (a), the object relations information, with the smallest proportion (25%), but is the most discriminative for extracting and localizing Theft events. More seriously, global spatial information is the most frequent and our preliminary experiments in Figure 7 (a) reveal global expert is often more thoroughly trained and often have the highest weights. Therefore, a better-behaved MoE expert fusion mechanism should mitigate this data imbalance (named global-local spatial balancing challenge), ensuring all experts are sufficiently trained to highlight their importance.

To tackle above challenges, we propose a Global-local Spatialsensitive LLM named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down criminal events, for M-VAE. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module to address the global-local spatial modeling challenge, which includes four spatial experts to extract spatial information and an expert gate to weigh global and local spatial information. Furthermore, this model designs a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the global-local spatial balancing challenge, which includes a Gated Spatial Balancing Loss (GSB) to further balance global and local experts. Particularly, we construct a M-VAE instruction dataset to better evaluate the effectiveness of our model. Detailed experiments show Sherlock can effectively extract and localize abnormal events and surpass advanced Video-LLMs in multiple evaluation metrics.

## 2 Related Work

· Video Anomaly Detection. Video Understanding is a rapidly evolving research field which encompasses several tasks, including video grounding [40 , 58 , 59], spatial-temporal detection [13] and so on. As an important branch of video understanding, previous studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can be categorized into unsupervised, weakly-supervised, and fully-supervised categories. Unsupervised approaches focus on leveraging reconstruction techniques to identify anomalies [15 , 20 , 62 , 64]. Weaklysupervised methods have shown promising results in identifying abnormal frames [11 , 36 , 57 , 60 , 72]. Fully-supervised methods are scarce due to the expensive frame-level annotations required [7 , 10 , 12 , 19 , 53 , 55 , 70]. Different from the above studies, our Sherlock model aims to target at determining the underlying video semantic structure, providing a structured quadruple that goes beyond previous methods, facilitating the rapid detection and early warning of abnormal events in real-time.

· Event Extraction (EE) focuses on extracting structured information from given types of information. Traditional EE methods mainly extract from text documents [21 , 25 , 35 , 37 , 52]. Recently, many studies [2 , 44 , 66 – 68] generate similar event structures from visual image data. Different from all the above studies, we are the first to focus on extracting the abnormal event from videos and constructing a quadruple dataset, incorporating information from

multiple spatial information, enriching the task of event extraction, and making it more practical for real-world applications.

· Video-oriented Large Language Models. The rise of ChatGPT [49] has stimulated the prosperity of Video Large Language Models which can be categorized into four major types: firstly, Video Chat [34] and Video LLaMA [69], which utilize BLIP-2 [33] and Q-Former to map visual representations onto Vicuna; secondly, models like Video ChatGPT [47], Otter [31], Valley [46], mPLUGOwl [65], and Chat-UniVi [26], which leverage CLIP [51] to encode visual features; thirdly, PandaGPT [54], which adopts ImageBind [14] as its core architecture for video understanding; and fourthly, VideoLLaVA [38], which aligns image and video features into a linguistic feature space using LanguageBind [73]. Recently, a few studies [27 , 63] consider incorporating spatial information in models. Besides, some studies [18 , 23 , 24] introduce the concept of MoE into LLMs, but they only focus on efficiency, without considering the balance between different information. Different from all the above studies, we design a new Sherlock model, to address our M-VAE task, which includes a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator to address the challenges of global-local modeling and balancing.

## 3 Our Sherlock Model

In this paper, we propose a Sherlock model to address the MVAE task. Figure 2 illustrates the framework of Sherlock, which is composed of two core components (i.e., the Global-local Spatialenhanced MoE (GSM) module (sec 3.1) for the global-local spatial modeling challenge and the Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) (sec 3.2) for the global and local spatial balancing challenge). Subsequently, we present our training strategies to enhance the ability of understanding spatial information (sec 3.3).

Backbone. We choose Video-LLaVA [38] and its visual encoder LanguageBind [73] as the core framework. Video-LLaVA, which is optimized with a mixed dataset of images and videos, demonstrates leading performance across most image and video benchmarks. We employ Video-LLaVA as the backbone to explore the potential of Video-LLMs in extracting and localizing abnormal events.

Task Formulation. Given a video 𝑉 for 𝑀 frames, each frame is labeled with 1 or 0, where 1 and 0 represent whether this frame conveys an abnormal event. The goal of M-VAE is to interactively generate the quadruple (𝑠𝑢𝑏 , 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 , 𝑜𝑏 𝑗 , 𝑠𝑐𝑒 ) for each event along with the corresponding timestamp 𝑠𝑡𝑎 and 𝑒𝑛𝑑, where 𝑠𝑢𝑏 , 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 , 𝑜𝑏 𝑗 , 𝑠𝑐𝑒 , 𝑠𝑡𝑎 and 𝑒𝑛𝑑 are the subject, event type, object, scene, start time and end time of the abnormal event. As shown in Figure 1 (a), a man steals a car at street from 23s to 25s. Therefore, the output of our M-VAE task is {23s , 25s, (people , steal, l, car, r, street)}.

## 3.1 Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE Module

As shown in Figure 2, we design a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) Module for the global-local spatial modeling challenge. Inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [24], we design three Local Spatial Experts (i.e., Local Action Expert, Local Object Relation

Expert and Local Background Expert) and a Global Spatial Expert to extract spatial information, detailed as follows.

Local Spatial Experts contain three local spatial experts (i.e., action, object relation, and background), detailed as follows.

· Local Action Expert (Action Expert, AE). We leverage HigherHRNet [6], a well-adopted bottom-up human pose estimation network to extract local spatial action information. HigherHRNet can generate local spatial action tokens T 𝒂 = {𝒕 𝒂 1
, ..., 𝒕 𝒂 𝒊
, ..., 𝒕 𝒂 𝒎 }, and each token consists of 17 human joint nodes for each individual in every frame of a video sequence. Here, 𝑖 denotes the 𝑖-th frame. Next, we apply Action Graph Attention to integrate T 𝒂 with the video tokens T 𝒗 = {𝒕 𝒗 1
, ..., 𝒕 𝒗 𝒊
, ..., 𝒕 𝒗 𝒎 } generated by the Video Encoder in Video-LLMs. We start by calculating the attention weights 𝛼 𝑘 𝑗 for each node 𝑒𝑘in 𝒕 𝒂 𝒊 relative to its neighboring node 𝑒𝑗:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ℎ𝑘 and ℎ𝑗is the features of 𝑒𝑘 and 𝑒𝑗 respectively. Wa denote the learnable weight matrix, and 𝑑 is the feature dimension. Then we aggregate the feature ˆ ℎ𝑘 of node 𝑒𝑘: ˆ ℎ𝑘 =
Í
𝑗 ∈N ( 𝑒𝑘 ) 𝛼 𝑘 𝑗 · ℎ𝑗 , where N (𝑒𝑘) is the neighboring nodes of 𝑒𝑘. Finally the feature of 𝑒𝑘is calculated by ℎ ′ 𝑘 = ReLU(Wk[ ˆ ℎ𝑘, ℎ𝑘]), where W a donates the weight matrix and [ ˆ ℎ𝑘, ℎ𝑘] is the concatenation of ˆ ℎ𝑘 and ℎ𝑘 .

After graph attention operation, we enhance T 𝒂 using the attention mechanism with query Q 𝒗 , key K 𝒂 , and value V 𝒂 calculation to obtain final action tokens: T ′ 𝒂 = softmax Q ⊤ 𝒗 · K 𝒂 
· V 𝒂.

- Local Object Relation Expert (Object Relation Expert, ORE). We leverage RelTR [9], a well-studied one-stage object relation graph generation method to extract local spatial object relation information. RelTR can generate an object relation token 𝒕 𝒐 𝒊 = (𝑅𝑖

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝜎 is the activation function on the graph. A ˜ is the adjacency matrix of the object-relation graph, derived from 𝐸𝑖, and D ˜ is its degree matrix, with D ˜ 𝑖𝑖 = Í
𝑖 A ˜ 𝑖𝑗 . W (ℓ) is a trainable weight matrix.

· Local Background Expert (Background Expert, BE). We leverage SAM2 [28], an advanced model for visual segmentation, to extract local spatial background information from videos. SAM2 can generate a background image for each frame of video. Then we leverage InternVit [5] to encode local spatial background information which is a large vision encoder extending the parameters of vision transformer (VIT) [4] to 6B, formally represented as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑣𝑖is the 𝑖-th frame of video 𝑉 . This process results in the local spatial background tokens T𝒃 = {𝒕 𝒃 1
, ..., 𝒕 𝒃 𝒊
, ..., 𝒕 𝒃 𝒎 } for the entire video sequence, with 𝑛 representing the total number of frames.

Global Spatial Expert has a comprehensive understanding of the training data. Collaborate with local spatial experts to bring specialization and generalization capabilities to M-VAE tasks.

· Global Spatial Expert (Global Expert, GE). The weight assigned to the global spatial expert complements that of the local spatial experts. Consequently, the local spatial experts acquire specialized skills for specific tasks, whereas the global spatial expert develops a comprehensive understanding of the entire training corpus. The collaboration between these two types of experts provides both specialization and generalization for our M-VAE task. In this way, we leverage LanguageBind [73] in Video-LLaVA [38], which inherits the ViT-L/14 structure from CLIP and is equipped with powerful and universal visual encoding capabilities to extract global spatial information for our task. We subsequently leverage a pre-trained FFN layer by [38] to align the dimension with other spatial information, formally represented as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑣𝑖is the 𝑖-th frame of video 𝑉 . This process yields the full set of global tokens T 𝒈 = {𝒕 𝒈 1
, ..., 𝒕 𝒈 𝒊
, ..., 𝒕 𝒈 𝒎 } for the entire video sequence, with 𝑛 representing the total number of frames.

After designing four experts, we ensure that the four Spatial Experts can dynamically adjust the weights of the four heterogeneous types of spatial information inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [18]. As shown in Figure 2, unlike methods that embed several FFNs within LLMs, our GSM put four experts outside the LLMs to adjust weights for global and local spatial information. Based on this, we introduce a dynamic Expert Gate (EG) [50], which controls the contribution of each expert by calculating gating weights as a soft gate. Finally, the output O of GSM, based on four spatial experts and EG, is formally represented as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where LayerNorm (·) indicates layer normalization [1]. 𝑔𝑖(the 𝑖-th entry in 𝒈) represents the weight of the 𝑖-th expert. Si represents the outputs of the 𝑖-th Spatial expert. 𝑁 is the total number of spatial expert, and W 𝑔 being the trainable weight matrix.

## 3.2 Spatial Imbalance Regulator

After modeling the spatial information, we design a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) including a Gated Spatial Balancing Loss (GSB) for the global-local spatial balancing challenge, detailed as follows.

Gated Spatial Balancing (GSB) Loss. Previous researches employ a basic Mixture of Experts (MoE) [18 , 23] to model global and local spatial information. When faced with an imbalance between these two types of information, the weights assigned to experts tend to be biased toward those that appear more frequently. As shown in Figure 1 (c), there are the most spatial elements (e.g., People) related to local spatial action information in event quadruple. This implies that performance will deteriorate when faced with real-world data that is not processed by an action expert (e.g., object relations). More seriously, as shown in Figure 1 (c), global information holds significant weight in all data, which will lead to excessive training of global experts and weaken the abilities of local experts with lower weights. This imbalance phenomenon will greatly affect the performance of our model. Based on this, we should keep the weights of all spatial experts not too different and achieve the optimal state of relative balance where every expert is fully trained. Inspired by MoELoRA [42], we propose a Gated Spatial Balancing (GSB) Loss to balance spatial weights, as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝑁local is the number of local expert. 𝑔global is the weight of global expert. The first term of Eq.(7) is balancing between local experts, and the second term is balancing between local and global experts. The weights of four experts have already balanced when the loss is optimized to a minimum. This regulation achieves a better balance among all experts, reducing the impact of data imbalance, which effectively addresses the global-local balancing challenge. Finally, the overall loss of Sherlock can be represented as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝛼 is the hyper-parameter that controls the strength of Lgate , and LD is the next-token prediction loss of Video-LLMs.

## 3.3 Training Strategies for Sherlock

In order to enhance the ability of understanding spatial information, we design a two-stage training process. Stage 1 is to enhance the ability of understanding spatial information and Stage 2 is to address the M-VAE task, detailed as follows.

Stage 1. Pre-Tuning for spatial understanding. As shown in Figure 2, we first pre-tune Video-LLaVA using four high-quality

datasets. We aim for Video-LLaVA to have a good spatial understanding ability. Specifically, we selected four high-quality datasets: HumanML3D [16], Ref-L4 [3], RSI-CB [32], and COCO-Caption [39], as described in sec 4.1. For each pre-tuning dataset, we enable this dataset to understand corresponding spatial information.

Stage 2. Instruction Tuning for M-VAE task. We aim to enable the model to localize abnormal events and extract quadruples through the chat paradigm. We construct an instruction tuning dataset described in sec 4.1 and instruct the pre-tuned Video-LLaVA to Extract quadruples and localize abnormal events. The quadruple includes subject, event type, object, and scene in abnormal events. The instruction will undergo text embedding to obtain the textual tokens T 𝒕 . Finally, the input of the LLM is "O from Eq.(5) + T𝒕".

## 4 Experimental Settings

## 4.1 Instruction Data Construction

The training pipeline of Sherlock contains two stages. As shown in Figure 4, for each stage, we construct the corresponding instruction dataset for better tuning.

For Stage 1. We construct a special understanding dataset based on Ref-L4 [3], HumanML3D [16], RSI-CB [32] and COCO [39]. Specifically, we manually design an instruction for each type of spatial information, for instance: Instruction: "Judge the action of the characters in the image. Describe the image region &lt;objs&gt; in the image. Judge the background of the image. Describe the image". As HumanML3D has 25K videos with an average duration of 1 second, and we take 8 frames per second. For the data balance, we randomly select 20K images or frames from each dataset.

For Stage 2. We construct an M-VAE instruction dataset based on CUVA [10], which primarily consists of surveillance videos, with an average duration of 80 seconds per video. As this dataset includes five detailed video Q-A tasks (i.e., timestamp, classification, reason, result, and description tasks), it is highly beneficial for constructing our M-VAE dataset. 1) For abnormal event quadruples, constructing quadruples involves two steps. First, we collect answers from the reason, result, and description tasks in CUVA for each video. Subsequently, we construct initial quadruples through ChatGPT [49] based on the answers to these tasks, with the instruction: "Please extract the subject, object, and scene of the event based on the responses below". Second, we create multiple candidate sets for subjects, objects, and scenes in quadruple. Specifically, for subjects and objects elements, we manually construct a set of around 40 for subjects and objects and filter elements based on this set. For event types elements, we adopt the 11 categories (i.e., Fighting, Animals, Water, Vandalism, Accidents, Robbery, Theft, Pedestrian, Fire, Violations, and Forbidden) from CUVA as the event types. For

scenes elements, we assign two annotators to classify scenes for each abnormal event. If they cannot reach an agreement, an expert will make the final decision to ensure annotation quality. The Kappa consistency check value of the annotation is 0.87. 2) For localization task, we use the timestamp in the CUVA as labels for localization. Furthermore, we adhere to the split of CUVA for training and inference videos and take 8 frames per second, resulting in 800K frames from 1k videos and each video contains 1.68 abnormal event on average. The statistics of the number of events and the duration in seconds (s) of events for each scene are shown in Table 1. Finally, we obtain our M-VAE instruction dataset. Our instruction for the M-VAE task is: "Generate a quadruple and localize an abnormal event in the video. The quadruple includes subject, event type, object, and scene in abnormal events.". Figure 1 (c) and Figure 3 show the top 20 quadruple elements, revealing the spatial imbalance.

## 4.2 Baselines

In this paper, we select several advanced Video-LLMs as baselines which are introduced as follows. VideoChat [47] employs Q-Former [33] to map visual representations to Vicuna [8]. VideoChatGPT [47] integrates LLMs with CLIP [51] for video representations. Valley [46] employs a temporal modeling module to bridge visual and textual modes. PandaGPT [54] utilizes ImageBind [14] to demonstrate cross-modal capabilities. mPLUG-Owl [65] introduces a visual abstractor module to align different modes. ChatUniVi [26] merges visual tokens with semantic meanings. VideoLLaVA [38] conducts joint training on images and videos. To ensure a fair comparison, we re-implement these models using their released codes in our experiments, with all LLMs sized at 7B.

## 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

M-VAE focuses on extracting event quadruples and locating abnormal events from videos, requiring evaluation metrics in three aspects (i.e., extract event quadruples, locate abnormal events, and classify abnormal events). For the extraction performance, we measure our model through three perspectives. 1) Single: performance of generating each individual element. 2) Pair: performance of generating the element pair, i.e., Subject-Type pair, Object-Type pair, Subject-Scene pair, Object-Scene pair. 3) Quadruple Generation: performance of generating the complete event quadruple. Following the prior works [30], the performance is evaluated with Macro-F1. Furthermore, we use T5-based and GPT-based metrics based on Video-bench [48] especially for LLM. For localization performance, we use the mAP@tIoU metric [71], calculated by mean Average Precision (mAP) at different IoU thresholds from 0.1 to 0.3 with 0.1 intervals. For classification performance, we refer to the traditional anomaly classification task [17 , 45 , 61] for anomaly classification metric, which mainly determines whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video. We prefer Recall over Precision and report F2 [71] as another classification metric. Furthermore, our model focuses on accurately distinguishing abnormal events. As shown in Figure 1, it's better to mark all timestamps as abnormal than to miss any. So we prioritize false negative rates (FNRs): FNRs = num of false-negative frame num of positive frame , which is the rate of mislabeling an abnormal event frame as normal. In addition, 𝑡-test is used to evaluate the significance of the performance.

## 4.4 Implementation Details

In our experiments, we utilize open-source codes to obtain experimental results of all the baselines in Table 2. The hyper-parameters of these baselines remain the same setting reported by their public papers. For both Stage 1 and 2, we use a batch size of 16 and train for 1 epoch with the AdamW [43] optimizer and a cosine learning rate decay schedule with a warm-up period. The initial learning rate is 2e-5. The hyper-parameter 𝛼 in L is set to 0.4. We tune the Video-LLaVA model using LoRA [22]. The LoRA matrix dimension, dropout rate, and dropout rate are 16, 64, and 0.05 respectively. Experiments are run on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB memory. Stage 1 training takes about 16 hours, Stage 2 takes 60 hours, and inference takes about 8 hours.

an average improvement of 10.85 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05) over the second performance. Specifically, our Sherlock model surpasses the second performance by an average of 9.9 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05), 8.59 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05), and 9.52 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05) in average Single, Pair, and Quadruple metrics, justifying the effectiveness of Sherlock on extraction task. For localization performance, our Sherlock model exceeds the second performance by 11.42 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01) in average mAP@tIoU metric, justifying the effectiveness of Sherlock on localization task. Furthermore, for classification performance, in FNRs and F2 metric, Sherlock surpasses the second performance in 18.38 (𝑝value &lt; 0.01) and 14.43 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01). This implies the importance of our global and local information and justifies the effectiveness of our Sherlock model on our task.

## 5.2 Contributions of Each Key Component

In order to further investigate the contributions of different modules of Sherlock, we conduct an ablation study on our Sherlock model. As shown in Table 2, w/o AE, w/o ORE, w/o BE, w/o GE, w/o EG,

and w/o pre-tuning represent without four Spatial Experts, Expert Gate, and pre-tuning stage in sec 3.2 respectively.

Effectiveness Study of Global and Local Spatial Expert . From Table 2, we can see that: The performance of w/o AE , w/o ORE , w/o BE and w/o GE degrades in all metrics, with an average decrease of 7.54 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), 7.57 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), 4.37 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), and 5.68 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01) in FNRs, F2, average map@tIoU, and average event extraction metrics. This confirms the importance of global and local information in extracting and localizing abnormal events, and Sherlock can better model those information well.

Effectiveness Study of Spatial Imbalance Regulator. From Table 2, we can see that: 1) Compared with Sherlock , w/o EG shows poorer performance in all metrics, with a decrease of FNRs, F2, average map@tIoU, and average extraction performance by 15.34 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), 16.52 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), 8.62 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05) and 10.36 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), respectively. This demonstrates the effectiveness of GSM in global-local spatial modeling and encourages us to consider handling heterogeneity issues between spatial information in the manner of MoE. 2) From Table 2, we can see that compared to performance of w/o SIR, the performance of w/o MG is poorer, with FNRs, F2, average map@tIoU, and average event extraction metrics decreasing by 1.94 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05), 3.9 (𝑝-value

&lt; 0.05), 1.13 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05) and 4.84 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.05), respectively. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of Lgate in global-local spatial balancing and encourages us to consider using SIR to better balance spatial information. 3) In addition, we record the weights of four spatial experts after training in Figure 6 and Figure 7 (a). We can see that the weights of all experts have been relatively balanced, and each expert has demonstrated outstanding professional abilities when facing different types of abnormal videos.

Effectiveness Study of Pre-tuning. From Table 2, we can see that w/o pre-tuning, the performance is inferior to Sherlock . FNRs, F2, average map@tIoU, and average event extraction metrics have decreased by 17.63 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), 16.95 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), 10.92 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01) and 11.48 (𝑝-value &lt; 0.01), respectively. This further justifies the effectiveness of pre-tuning, as well as encourages us to use more high-quality datasets to enhance the spatial understanding ability of Video-LLMs before instruction-tuning.

## 5.3 Convergence Analysis and Practical Assessment for Sherlock

In order to analyze the convergence of Sherlock, we record the loss of baseline Video-LLMs, Sherlock, and its variant without specific components over various training steps. The results are shown in Figure 5 and we can see that: 1) Sherlock demonstrates the fastest convergence compared to other Video-LLMs. At the convergence point, the loss of Sherlock is 1.05, while Video-LLaVA is 2.06. This underscores the high efficiency of Sherlock over other advanced Video-LLMs. 2) Sherlock demonstrates the fastest convergence compared to its variant without specific components in Figure 5. This justifies that the spatial information along with GSM and SIR can accelerate the convergence process, which further encourages us to consider the spatial information in the M-VAE task.

To assess practicality, we analyze the FNRs of Sherlock for each scene. As shown in Table 3, we can observe that in every scene, Sherlock outperforms other Video-LLMs. This indicates that the possibility of misclassifying abnormal events as normal events is minimized, thereby demonstrating the importance of global and local spatial modeling of Sherlock. We also analyze the average inference time in seconds for a one-minute video. As shown in Figure 7 (b), Sherlock does not perform much differently from the other models in terms of inference time. This is reasonable, as some studies confirm that the MoE architecture can improve efficiency

[11, 28]. This suggests that introducing more information along with a MoE module for the M-VAE task does not increase the inference time and Sherlock can maintain good inference efficiency.

## 5.4 Qualitative Analysis for Sherlock

As shown in Figure 8, we visualize and compare Sherlock with other Video-LLMs. We randomly select two samples from our dataset and ask these models to Analyze the following video and localize the timestamp and extract the quadruple of the abnormal events. From the figure, we can see that: 1) Accurately localizing abnormal events and extracting correct quadruples is a huge challenge. For instance, example 2 captures a segment from 9s to 15s, where identifying the collision of the truck at road is challenging, 2) Compared with other advanced Video-LLMs, Sherlock shows excellent performance in localizing abnormal events. In example 1, Sherlock outperforms other models in terms of accuracy. In example 2, it outperforms PandaGPT in terms of accuracy and can generate a correct quadruple. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of Sherlock in precisely extracting and localizing abnormal events.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we firstly propose a new M-VAE task and a constructed instruction dataset, making a significant contribution to future research on abnormal events. Secondly, we propose a Globallocal Spatial-sensitive LLM named Sherlock to assist in localizing and extracting abnormal event quadruples. This model includes a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE module and Spatial Imbalance Regular to model and balance spatial information. In the end, our experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of Sherlock. In future work, we hope to consider the relationships between events and enrich our tasks with event inference to improve the performance of extraction. In addition, we also hope to improve the interpretability of our model by providing explanations for each abnormal event.
